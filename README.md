### Factors that impact AirBnB rental pricing  
**Shweta Raizada**

#### Executive summary
Despite of economic slowdown, travel in the US continues to boom year over year. People are traveling in large groups, with families, and for extended period of time, contributing to the popularity of vacation rentals like AirBnB. Unlike hotels, the "home away from home" advantage of AirBnB seems to be attractive to travelers. This analysis is attempting to find the factors that could impact the pricing of such rentals. 

#### Rationale
1.	As families or big groups travels and use AirBnB, it’d be useful to find what characteristics draw higher prices. If those characteristics aren’t important to the travelers, they can skip those rentals and save money. This sort of analysis can be especially be useful for families traveling on a budget.
2.	When listing their place, hosts could also use this to gauge what a reasonable price for their listing could be. 

#### Research Question
Are there any some Airbnb characteristics that draw higher prices than others at popular destinations, and do these characteristics differ by the kind of destination? 

#### Data Sources
Airbnb data for listings containing details of the property like characteristics, descriptions, amenities, location, and prices.
Inside AirBnB is an excellent collaboration that has put together a lot of data on AirBnB rentals with the intent to provide data and advocacy about Airbnb's impact on residential communities. We can source the data from this website.

We will use data from cities (NYC, Los Angeles, Chicago, Seattle), mountain towns (Asheville, Bozeman, Denver) and coastal cities (Hawaii, San Diego, Pacific Grove). 

#### Methodology
1.	Exploratory data analysis
2.	Feature engineering to prepare data.
3.	Various Regression algorithms to find contributing factors

#### Results
Besides the obvious number of beds and baths, we did note other parameters that contribute to a vacation rentals increased cost. Notably, presence of a hot tub or pool can drive up the prices. Rentals that require a high minimum number of nights, seems to be costing less on an average which can be useful for families in case they want to save $$$ by extending their vacation by a day or so, or by specifically finding properties that requires a minimum number of nights. 

#### Next steps
1. Identify patterns based on location type
2. Clearly state that factors can impact the cost of a vacation rental and avoiding which features can save the consumer some money.
